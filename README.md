## Notes

- Configuring Vite for the first time and adding a custom Google Font took some experimentation.  
- Learning CSS Grid was new but made the responsive layout straightforward.  
- Ensuring the neon glow effect (text-shadow and box-shadow) matched a retro arcade feel required tweaking color and shadow values.
